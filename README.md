# CoronaEXE.exe 

 Just a little piece of trollware ( malware for trolling ) that i made when i was bored. Dubbed it "CoronaEXE.exe" just like what Covid19 does, it duplicates itself in a very aggressive once in contact with someone ( in this case, when you touch its GUI-close button :} ) and it also spreads very fast. Feel free not to run it or do it if it please you. :P

### Build :
---
- Wonder where did the actual executable go and you wanna try it out ? In order to avoid script kiddies, i have deleted the piece of malware in my project, if you wish to try it out, compile my source codes from my repository in order to obtain it.
- if you are intending to record my malware in action without virtualizing it in any kind of VM, compile the soure codes in the `CoroRecord` directory. Please note that that version doesn't support all kind of Desktop-recording software, only a few listed below :
```
        1. OBS Studio ( obsproject.com )
        2. ShareX ( getsharex.com )
        3. Free Cam ( freescreenrecording.com )
        4. Camtasia ( techsmith.com ) NOT YET
        5. Camstudio ( camstudio.org )
        6. Ezvid ( ezvid.com )
        7. filmora ( filmora.wondershare.net )
```
- Apart from any of those, the malware will automatically shut down the rest without hesitation, if one wish to record it with another Desktop-recording program, issue a request and i will try to add it in.
### Disclaimer :
---
- Please note that i only made this malware for fun and i `won't be taking` any `responsibility` upon any of your actions if you try to abuse this executable for `mischievous purposes`. This malware doesn't have any devastating consequence but still very annoying once executed.
- To avoid script kiddies who only copy and paste malware to wreck havoc, i have deleted my self-built executable, if you wanna try it out, compile my codes and obtain it.
